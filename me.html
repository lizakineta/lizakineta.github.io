    <p style="font-family: caviar dreams; font-size: 20px; color:black;"><b>Hi, my name is LIza S. Kineta, 20 years old and I'am a College (freshman) student of Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig (PLP) taking Bachelors degree in Information Technology.
      I chose that field of study because I’ve always been interested in computer (programming), and a couple of family members told me it leads to great career options, too.

<b>&#8711 Family ART &#8711 </b> <br><br>
My family consist of 5 members - My Grandafather, Uncle, Mother, Sister, and me. They all have been an important part of my life and have encouraged me much to take this step
and I'm sure with their love, support and blessings I shall fulfill all my dreams.<br><br>

<b>&#8711 Friends &#8711 </b> <br><br>
Meeting our friend for the first time is not a pre -planned incident. It's a coincidence. 
I get closer to them when I understand that he/she can cope up with me and truly likes to be my bestie .
 one day we both felt that we both had the same passion and she can understand me very well. Since that day till now we both are besties and I hope it would continue forever.

And also I got closer to another friend who needed me to be with her as her friend. She is one of my special friends. She is the one who motivated me during my failures and fears and gave good advices in bad times</p>

     <p style="font-family: caviar dreams; color:black; font-size: 20px;"> <b> LISTENING TO MUSIC <br>
      Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. 
      Music gives me the needed refuge whenever I feel like my head is spinning
       and I just want to shut out everything around me. The good thing about music
        is that there is music for every occasion and feeling. Whenever I feel depressed, 
        I listen to sad songs. They guide me and keep me company during those trying moments.
         Whenever I’m happy, I have a collection of party songs that I dance to for hours to 
         amplify the good feeling. The beauty of music is that it can be incorporated with other 
         hobbies. For instance, I love reading a good book, as nice orchestra music is playing in 
         the background.<br><br>

         READING BOOKS <br>
         I’m passionate about reading. Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies, 
         reading books is what resonates well with me. There are many reasons why I love reading.
          The first reason is it gives me a level of fulfillment. That is, books rejuvenate me.
           After reading a book, I feel like a whole new being and my outlook in life changes.
         The second reason is books make my mind sharp. It is a known fact that books improve our 
         brain muscles. They make us think better and improve our decision making abilities.
          I find it funny that whenever I utter a clever quote from a book, everyone around me would 
          be dumbfounded.

  <h2>*</h2> <br> <br>
  <p style="font-size:20px; color:black">
<b>&#8711 STRENGTH &#8711 </b> <br> 
* I’m an empathetic person who is skilled at relating to people and understanding their needs. <br>
I believe that my greatest strength is the ability to solve problems quickly and efficiently. <br>I can see any given situation from multiple perspectives, which makes me uniquely qualified to complete my work <br>
even under challenging conditions. That problem solving allows me to be a better communicator. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>&#8711 WEAKNESSES &#8711</b><br>
 * I tend to be overly critical of myself. Whenever I complete a project, I can’t help but feel that I could have done more even <br>if my work received a positive response. 
 This often leads me to overwork myself and leaves me feeling burned out. <br> <br>
